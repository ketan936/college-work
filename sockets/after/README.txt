This distribution contains the contents of each chapter after the
chapter is complete.  You can just cd into each directory, type
"make" and see the software for the associated chapter built.

Alternatively, if you'd rather follow along with the book, tutorial
style, download the "before" distribution that just shows you what
each chapter begins with and allows you to fill in the source files
step-by-step.
